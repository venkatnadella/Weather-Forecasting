Our project aims to develop an advanced weather forecasting system by leveraging the capabilities
of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. The project involves the
integration of IoT sensors to collect real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity,
wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. These sensors will be strategically deployed across
different geographical locations to ensure comprehensive data coverage.

The collected data will then be fed into our machine learning algorithms for analysis and
prediction. Through the utilization of various ML techniques such as regression, time series
analysis, and neural networks, we aim to build a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting
weather conditions over short and long-term intervals.


Key Objectives:
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality.
2. Development of machine learning models for weather prediction.
3. Integration of ML algorithms with the IoT infrastructure.
4. Evaluation and validation of the forecasting model's accuracy and reliability.
5. Deployment of the weather forecasting system for practical use.
   
Expected Outcomes:
1. Enhanced accuracy in weather forecasting compared to traditional methods.
2. Real-time monitoring and prediction of weather conditions.
3. Improved preparedness for weather-related events such as storms, heatwaves, or cold
snaps.
4. Potential applications in agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.
5. Contribution to the advancement of IoT and ML technologies in the field of meteorology.
   
Overall, our project aims to bridge the gap between IoT and ML to revolutionize weather
forecasting, ultimately benefiting various industries and improving societal resilience to weatherrelated challenges.
